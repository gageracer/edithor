# Chunking Test Document

This is a test to verify the chunking behavior with segments that exceed the character limit.

## Test Story

### Voice Script Segments

**Segment 1:** (800 characters)
This is a very long segment that definitely exceeds the 490 character limit and should be split into multiple segments. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum. Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo.

**Segment 2:** (300 characters)
This segment is under the limit and should remain as a single segment. It contains enough text to be meaningful but not so much that it needs to be split. The system should preserve this as one segment while properly numbering it after the previous segment's chunks.

**Segment 3:** (650 characters)
Another long segment that will need chunking. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs. How vexingly quick daft zebras jump! The five boxing wizards jump quickly. Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow. Two driven jocks help fax my big quiz. Quick zephyrs blow, vexing daft Jim. How quickly daft jumping zebras vex. Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex. Glib jocks quiz nymph to vex dwarf. Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz. The jay, pig, fox, zebra and my wolves quack! Blowzy red vixens fight for a quick jump. Quick wafting zephyrs vex bold Jim. Quick zephyrs blow, vexing daft Jim.

### Voice Script Segments

**Segment 1:** (245 characters)
Welcome to our platform! This is the first segment of our voice script.
It demonstrates how the chunking system works with visual highlights.
Each segment should be clearly marked and highlighted in blue when detected.

**Segment 2:** (198 characters)
This is the second segment. Notice how each segment marker follows the
pattern defined in the filter panel. The system uses regex to find and
highlight these markers automatically.

**Segment 3:** (312 characters)
The third segment shows how longer content is handled. The highlighting
should span the entire marker text including the asterisks, segment number,
and character count. This helps you visually identify where each segment
begins in your document for better organization.

**Segment 4:** (156 characters)
Short segments work too! The highlighting system is flexible and adapts
to content of any length while maintaining consistent visual feedback.

**Segment 5:** (287 characters)
This fifth segment adds more test content to verify the highlighting
continues to work correctly with multiple segments. The blue background
and left border should be consistent across all markers, making it easy
to scan through your document quickly.

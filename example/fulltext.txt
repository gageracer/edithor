Elias Hart had learned, over the years, that most of his life happened in between places.

Between his apartment and the office.  
Between meetings and school pick‑ups.  
Between the loud insistence of everyone else’s priorities and the quiet, folded shape of his own.

The bus, at least, was honest about the in‑betweenness.

It shuddered as it pulled away from the curb, a heavy old machine exhaling a tired breath. Evening rain smeared city lights across the windows, turning red brake lamps and street signs into long, blurry strokes of color. The air inside was a mix of damp wool, deodorant, and the faint metallic smell of old coins.

Elias sat a few rows behind the driver, close enough to see the road, far enough to avoid the draft from the doors. His gray coat was still mostly dry; his shoulder bag felt heavier than it actually was. He rested the rolled‑up plans against his leg, fingers absently smoothing the paper’s edge.

His mind, as usual, was somewhere else entirely.

Numbers.  
Heights.  
Flood projections.  
Public perception.

The waterfront project lived in his head like a second nervous system. He saw it even now, overlaid on the blurred city outside the bus window: the aging seawall traced in thin red; new pedestrian paths sketched in bright blue; the disputed pier outlined in a nervous, blinking orange.

He knew the talking points by heart. Economic resilience. Climate adaptation. Community benefit.

He also knew how it sounded to people who’d grown up fishing off that pier, or walking their dogs there, or sneaking beers out under the pylons as teenagers.

Gentrification. Displacement. Selling out.

He turned the phrases over in his mind, fitting them against each other like puzzle pieces that refused to lock.

A thin reflection moved in the bus window beside his own. At first, he didn’t register it. Just another passenger, another shape in the moving aquarium of the glass.

Then his eyes focused.

There, on the other side of the aisle, halfway down the bus, sat a woman with a sketchbook on her lap.

He saw her only as an overlay in the glass—his own face faintly visible, and hers next to it, both framed by streaks of rain.

She had her hair pulled back in a loose knot. A pair of headphones rested around her neck, not over her ears, as if she liked the idea of music but hadn’t committed to it yet. A pen was tucked behind one ear, in the habitual way of someone who misplaces pens a lot.

Her posture wasn’t casual, exactly, but concentrated. Focused inward. One hand steadied the sketchbook; the other moved quickly in small arcs and strokes. The page was tilted just enough that, when the bus passed under a streetlight, he caught a glimpse of what she was drawing.

A woman on a bicycle. Hair streaming back. A dog running alongside, its legs extended in mid‑leap.

The image was loose, half‑finished, but it had motion in it. Not just lines of a bike and a dog, but that slightly ridiculous, free kind of forward momentum that people always seemed to have in ads and almost never in real life.

He looked away, toward the road.

He wasn’t in the habit of staring at strangers.

There had been a time, years ago, when he moved through city spaces with the certainty that he was basically invisible: another body in the mass, another anonymous commuter. Then he’d started managing projects that actually changed things—“changed the built environment,” as the reports liked to phrase it—and he’d had to learn that sometimes people knew who he was before he entered the room.

Here, on the bus, he could almost have that anonymity back. And he wanted to keep it.

Still, a few minutes later, his gaze drifted back, caught not by the woman herself but by motion in the reflection: her hand turning the page, starting a new drawing.

Now, in quick rough lines, she was sketching the bus interior. The curve of the ceiling, the poles, the square of light at the door. A seated passenger with their chin in their hand. The driver, Tomasz, recognizable even in caricature: tall, broad‑shouldered, a little hunched, his thinning hair pulled back in a small knot.

Tomasz. Reliable as the morning forecast and twice as accurate.

“You’re quiet today, boss,” the driver called back without taking his eyes off the road.

It took Elias a second to realize that “boss” meant him.

“Long meeting,” he answered. His voice sounded like it had spent the day under fluorescent lights.

“Always a long meeting,” Tomasz said. “At least the rain makes people stay home. Less idiots on the road.”

A couple of passengers snorted. Someone muttered agreement. The woman with the sketchbook didn’t look up, but the corner of her mouth tugged up slightly, the movement clear even in the warped reflection.

The bus sighed to a halt at a red light. Outside, the intersection glowed wet and orange. A cyclist in a poncho waited at the line, blinking light strapped to his backpack, steam rising faintly from his shoulders.

Elias turned his head slightly, looking past his own reflection to the sidewalk.

This neighborhood—this stretch of old brick mixed with badly insulated newer apartments—was technically just outside the waterfront project’s boundaries. It would feel the effects anyway. Everything connected to everything else. Transit patterns. Rent prices. Who could afford to live near the water and who couldn’t.

A notification buzzed in his pocket. He fished out his phone, thumb already braced for more work.

Not work.

**Mara**: *You’re still picking me up, right? Nadia says art is over at 6, don’t be weirdly early.*

He glanced at the time. He was, in fact, running on track to be weirdly early.

He typed back, thumb moving more quickly now:

**Elias**: *On the bus. Two stops away. I’ll hover outside like an embarrassing ghost.*

Her reply came almost instantly.

**Mara**: *Dad.*

Just that. A whole paragraph’s worth of exasperation in one syllable.

He smiled in spite of himself, the expression unfamiliar but not unwelcome.

The bus lurched as the light changed. Another stop. A handful of people off, a handful on. The woman with the sketchbook shifted her bag, making room for an older man with a plastic grocery sack. The pen slipped from behind her ear; she caught it one‑handed, barely looking.

It was a small, practiced movement. He registered it more than he meant to.

His own stop blinked on the screen near the front: COMMUNITY CENTER – 2 MIN.

He tapped the rolled plans against his knee a couple of times, as if that could dislodge the meeting residue from his muscles. Flood risk maps. Cost overruns. Someone at the table saying, “Look, we all know nobody actually uses that old pier.”

He had bitten back the immediate contradiction—that he’d seen people there just last week, kids fishing with lines that probably weren’t legal, an old man with a transistor radio, teenagers passing a bottle in a paper bag.

He’d saved it for later. For the report. For the charts labeled “Observed Community Use.”

On the bus, now, he made himself stop thinking in bullet points.

The doors hissed open at the community center stop. The woman with the sketchbook didn’t move. She wasn’t getting off here.

He rose, adjusted the strap of his bag, and stepped down into the damp air.

The smell hit him first: wet pavement, fryer oil from the corner shop, the cold, metallic ghost of the sea the wind carried up from the harbor.

The community center squatted between a discount pharmacy and a shuttered video store, its brick facade softened by a mural of abstract, bright strokes—something half‑finished that had been there for at least two years.

The sign above the door flickered between “COMMUNITY CE TER” and “COMMUNITY CEN ER.”

He pushed the door open and walked into warmth and noise.

Kids’ voices. Chairs scraping. The wet squeak of sneakers on linoleum.

“Hi,” called the receptionist, an older man with a crossword book open in front of him. “She’s in the art room. Down the hall, second on the left.”

He hadn’t even asked, but apparently his patterns were known here, too.

He followed the sound of laughter and the faint, inescapable smell of acrylic paint.

The art room was a chaos of color. Long tables pushed together. Cups of cloudy water. Bright paper. The windows fogged slightly from the heat and breath of dozens of small bodies.

At one end, a woman in paint‑splattered overalls, a red bandana knotted at the back of her head, was doing an enthusiastic impression of a tree. Arms out, fingers splayed, voice booming.

“Nadia,” he remembered. She’d emailed him approximately fifteen times about “non‑sterile spaces” and “keeping weirdness in zoning.”

At another table, Mara sat with her back partly toward the door, camera strap looped diagonally across her chest, hair falling forward as she examined a print of something on her phone.

He took in the set of her shoulders—a little tense, but not closed. Good. Better than the hunched, turned‑away posture he sometimes saw when he picked her up from school.

He knocked lightly on the doorframe anyway.

“Hey,” he said.

Mara turned, already on the edge of a sigh. The sigh softened when she saw it was him and not another adult with another task.

“You’re early,” she said.

“You say that like it’s a crime.”

“Only a misdemeanor,” Nadia called, not looking up from the tree demonstration. “Come in, Elias. You’re making the hallway look underutilized.”

He stepped inside, the sensation of being the Only Man In The Art Room settling on his shoulders like a slightly ill‑fitting coat. He was not the only man, actually; there were a couple of teenage boys and one harried dad with a stroller. But among the paints and paper and awkward tweens, he always felt larger, more solid, more out of scale than he meant to.

At the nearest table, someone had opened a box of donuts. Half of them were already gone. Smears of chocolate and sugar dusted the paper.

“See?” Mara said, lifting her camera. “You’re late, actually. You missed the donut stampede.”

“Tragic,” he said. “I’ll contact my union.”

He caught movement at the corner of his eye and turned.

There, close‑up instead of in reflection, was the woman from the bus.

She stood with one hand on the back of a chair, the other holding a donut napkin. Up close, he saw extra details the bus window hadn’t given him: a faint ink smudge on her forearm, a small silver hoop in her left ear, the tiny vertical line between her eyebrows that deepened when she smiled.

A small jolt of recognition passed through him. Not big enough to call shock. Just the quiet click of two images aligning: bus window reflection, fluorescent reality.

She clearly had the same experience. Her eyes widened a fraction—not the kind of widening that said, *Oh no,* but the kind that said, *Oh. You exist outside that bus.*

“Hi,” she said, after half a second.

“Hi,” he answered.

He wasn’t sure if he should pretend they hadn’t shared air on public transit several times. He opted for acknowledging only the context in front of them.

“I’m Elias,” he said, stepping closer and offering a paint‑free hand. “Mara’s dad.”

“Lena,” she replied, her handshake briefly warm against his. “I… help out here. And bring sugar.”

“She brings bribery,” Mara corrected. “Which is way more important.”

Nadia spun around just in time to insert herself into the conversation.

“Ah, worlds colliding,” she declared. “Elias, this is the Lena I’ve been emailing you about, by the way. The one who draws actual humans instead of abstract concepts like ‘revitalization.’”

“I don’t think revitalization is abstract,” he said, by reflex.

Nadia tilted her head. “Tell that to the kids who’ll lose their practice space if you make the ground floor a juice bar.”

He opened his mouth, then closed it. Not tonight. There would be other meetings for that argument.

“We’re… still working on the ground floor plan,” he said, which was both noncommittal and true.

Lena’s gaze flicked between them, curious but not intervening. She had the air of someone used to standing at the edge of other people’s debates, sketching them as they happened.

Mara nudged his arm. “Can we go soon? I want to get some dusk shots on the way home before it gets too dark.”

“Yeah,” he said. “Sure. Let me just sign you out before they arrest me for child theft.”

Nadia waved a dismissive hand. “Take your photographer. And tell her to send me the shot where I look less like a tree and more like a visionary genius.”

“There is no such shot,” Mara said under her breath, but there was affection in it.

Elias scribbled his signature on the clipboard, handed back the pen, and turned to Lena again.

“Nice to meet you,” he said. It felt insufficient, but anything else would have been… what? *Nice to finally see you in three dimensions?* No.

“You too,” she said, and he had the odd sense that they were both leaving something unsaid, even though there was nothing yet to say.

Outside, the rain had settled into a fine mist. The bus stop across the street glowed faintly. The sky was that late‑blue color that always made him impatient; it meant the day had stolen more time than he’d noticed.

Mara walked a half‑step ahead of him, camera already out, stopping occasionally to take a quick shot of a puddle or a reflection in a shop window.

“Lena seems cool,” Elias said, as casually as he could manage.

Mara shrugged, which, in her language, translated to *yes, and I’m not going to give you the satisfaction of saying it outright.*

“She helped me with composition last week,” Mara said. “For portraits. I’m bad at people.”

“You just haven’t practiced them as much as decaying buildings,” he said.

“Buildings don’t blink or talk,” she replied. “They just sit there. It’s easier.”

He didn’t say what he was thinking—that she’d once been better at people than any building. That she’d been the kind of kid who climbed into strangers’ laps at the playground. That something, somewhere, had made her draw in like a sea creature retreating into its shell.

He walked beside her instead, listening to the soft shutter clicks of her camera, the occasional splash as their shoes hit deeper puddles.

A bus roared past in the opposite direction. Through the fogged windows he thought, maybe, he saw the outline of a woman with a sketchbook.

He couldn’t be sure.

At home, much later, with Mara’s shoes squeaking in the hallway and the kitchen light humming overhead, he emptied his bag onto the table.

Papers slid out in a controlled spill. Meeting notes. A folded map of the harbor. A small, stray leaflet that had adhered itself somehow to the cardboard backing of the plans.

He picked up the leaflet.

YOUTH ART PROGRAM – COMMUNITY CENTER, the title proclaimed in friendly, uneven letters. Below, a few photos: kids concentrating over paintings, a girl holding up a clay sculpture, a wide shot of the room.

On one of the smaller images, he recognized Mara at a table, head bent over a sketch. Beside her, Lena, slightly blurred from motion, reaching for a brush.

In the background, through the fogged window, there was a faint reflection. A gray coat. The outline of a man passing by outside, head down, plans under his arm.

He stared at that ghosted shape longer than he meant to.

The leaflet had been printed weeks ago.

So he had walked past this room, this window, this life his daughter had without him, more times than he’d been aware. He’d been on the other side of the glass, eyes on his emails, brain full of zoning regulations, while someone inside had caught him in the background of their world.

He let out a breath and set the leaflet down.

It slid, paper on paper, until it rested half‑covered by a flood risk chart.

He looked at the overlap for a moment—the map of the city he was trying to shape, and the tiny captured image of the life moving inside it.

He turned off the kitchen light.

The bus routes would be the same tomorrow. The meetings, the plans, the in‑between spaces.

He told himself that the woman with the sketchbook was just another part of the background of his days. A recurring extra in the film of his commute.

He told himself that the small pulse of interest he felt was nothing. An artifact. Static.

He’d been telling himself a lot of things, for a long time.

It had worked so far.

He went to bed with numbers in his head and the faint memory of ink‑stained fingers on his palm.

Sleep came slowly, like a bus running a little behind schedule.

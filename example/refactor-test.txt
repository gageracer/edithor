**Segment 1:** (487 characters)
I met Sarah on a Tuesday.  Not through an app—at a coffee shop, like people used to.  She was reading a book with a coffee-stained cover, and when our eyes met, she smiled like she'd been expecting me. I know how that sounds.  Like something from a romance novel. But that's exactly how it felt.  I sat down two tables away, pretending to work on my laptop while sneaking glances.  After twenty minutes, she walked over and said, "You're not actually working.  Your screen's been on the same page this whole time."

**Segment 2:** (492 characters)
I laughed, caught.  "Guilty.  I'm Tom." "Sarah," she said, extending her hand. Her grip was firm, confident. We talked for three hours straight.  The barista had to kick us out at closing.  We exchanged numbers in the parking lot under flickering streetlights. As she drove away, I remember thinking this was the beginning of something important. I had no idea how right I was.  Or how wrong everything would go.  That first night, she texted me: "Thanks for making my Tuesday less ordinary."

**Segment 3:** (498 characters)
Three months later, I thought I knew her. The way she took her coffee—oat milk, no sugar, extra hot. How she'd trace patterns on my palm while we talked, like she was reading my fortune. The small scar above her left eyebrow from a childhood accident she'd never fully explained. How she'd go quiet sometimes, staring at nothing, lost in thoughts she wouldn't share. I told myself everyone has secrets. Private corners of their past they keep locked away. I didn't push. I should have pushed.
